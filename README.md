R codes for simulation studies with small n, d and p were uploaded. One can easily modify the codes for larger n, d and p. The fortran dll files were created from some fortran codes that implemented the SBF methods. Unfortunately, the fortran codes will not be distributed until that an R package is created. Please understand it.
